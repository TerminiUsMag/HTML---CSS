        <img class="cats" src="PersianCat.jpg" alt="Persian Cat">
        <p class="textUnderPic">The Persian cat (Persian: گربه پارسی, romanized: Gorbe'-ye Pârsi) is a long-haired breed
            of cat characterized
            by its round face and short muzzle. It is also known as the "Persian Longhair" in English-speaking
            countries. The first documented ancestors of Persian cats were imported into Italy from Persia around
            1620. Widely recognized by cat fancy since the late 19th century, Persian cats were first adopted by
            the English, and then mainly by American breeders after World War II. Some cat fancier organizations' breed
            standards subsume the Himalayan and Exotic Shorthair as variants of this breed, while others treat them as
            separate breeds.</p>

        <h2 class="catsNameOnPic">Siberian</h2>
        <img class="cats" src="SiberianCat.jpg" alt="Siberian Cat">
        <p class="textUnderPic">The Siberian is a centuries-old landrace (natural variety) of domestic cat in Russia
            and recently
            developed as a formal breed with standards promulgated the world over since the late 1980s.
            Siberians vary from medium to medium-large in size. The formal name of the breed is Siberian Forest
            Cat, but usually it's simply called the Siberian or Siberian cat. Another formal breed name is the
            Moscow Semi-Longhair. The cat is an ancient breed that is now believed to be ancestral to all modern
            long-haired cats. The cat has similarities with the Norwegian forest cat, to which it is likely closely
            related. It is a natural breed from Siberia and the national cat of Russia. While it began as a
            landrace, it is selectively bred and pedigreed today in at least seven major cat fancier and breeder
            organizations. The colorpoint variant of the breed is called the Neva Masquerade by some registries,
            including Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFé).</p>

        <img class="cats" src="ScottishFoldCat.jpg" alt="Scottish Fold Cat">
        <p class="textUnderPic">The Scottish Fold is a breed of domestic cat with a natural dominant gene mutation that
            affects cartilage throughout the body, causing the ears to "fold", bending forward and down towards the
            front of the head, which gives the cat what is often described as an "owl-like" appearance.
            Lilac-colored Scottish Fold kitten
            Originally called lop-eared or lops after the lop-eared rabbit, Scottish Fold became the breed's name in
            1966. Depending on registries, longhaired Scottish Folds are varyingly known as Highland Fold, Scottish
            Fold Longhair, Longhair Fold and Coupari.</p>

        <h2 class="catsNameOnPic">Norwegian Forest Cat </h2>
        <img class="cats" src="NorwegianForestCat.jpg" alt="Norwegian Forest Cat">
        <p class="textUnderPic">The Norwegian Forest cat (Norwegian: Norsk skogkatt and Norsk skaukatt) is a breed of domestic cat originating in Northern Europe. This natural breed is adapted to a very cold climate, with a top coat of long, glossy, water-shedding hair and a woolly undercoat for insulation. The breed's ancestors may have been a landrace of short-haired cats brought to Norway about A.D. 1000 by the Vikings, who may also have brought with them long-haired cats, like those ancestral to the modern Siberian and Turkish Angora. During World War II, the Norwegian Forest cat was nearly extinct; then the Norwegian Forest Cat Club's breeding program increased the cat's number. It was registered as a breed with the European Fédération Internationale Féline in the 1970s, when a cat fancier, Carl-Fredrik Nordane, took notice of the breed and made efforts to register it. The breed is very popular in Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Iceland, and France.</p>
